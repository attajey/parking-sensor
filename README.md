Parking Sensor Using Arduino Uno and Ultrasonic Sensor
In this project I measure the distance using Ultrasonic sensor. By looking at my code you can see If Else for each range of distances and some actions take place in each one.
LEDs are used for indicating distance ranges. I used three LEDs to indicate the distance. 
In distances less than 10cm, a 12v fan will spin. This feature indicates that we can control one or even more pins for each distance. this feature can be used for many different appliances.
We can automatically turn on our car when something is getting too much close to it. We can turn off the lights when someone closes the door and leaves the room. And so on...
This is just a simple basic form of these kind of projects for guys and gals who want to built something fun. 
Remember to carefully look at the board architecture picture and then use this code. 

How To Run This Project : 
  1. At first you need Arduino Uno! So but it from somewhere. You also need all the sensors, resistors, transistors and LEDs that are shown in the picture.
  2. Install your Arduino driver on your operating system. If you are using fake chinese Arduinos, you should install CH34x driver. Google it and you'll find it. 
  3. Install Arduino IDE to compile my code on your Arduino. 
  4. If your are not familiar with Arduino IDE and how to compile a code, you should read some books! what I suggest is Arduino for Dummies by John Nussey. Just read the first and second chapter to learn how to use this IDE. 
  5. *****Be sure to check the Board architecture & implementation picture !!!!
  
  
-- I uploaded the chinese driver and a power point file. Feel free to use this power point for your own presentations. After all we are an open source community...A complete explanation of this project is implemented in the slides.
